        <h2>Why POLYWOOD?</h2>

        <p>
            POLYWOOD outdoor dining sets are designed with your family in mind. We’ve created durable outdoor dining tables
            and chairs that coordinate perfectly to make sets that can continually meet the dining demands and style preferences
            of any household. Whether you have a large family and favor a 9-piece outdoor dining set or 7-piece outdoor dining
            set with a rustic farmhouse design or have a smaller family with more contemporary tastes and desire a 5-piece
            outdoor dining set, there’s a curated outdoor dining set perfect for you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our modern outdoor dining sets are not only stylish — they’re sustainable too! All of our outdoor dining table
            and chairs are constructed from genuine POLYWOOD lumber, a durable material made using recycled ocean-bound and
            landfill-bound high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic. Our HDPE lumber is low-maintenance, easy to clean, can
            handle any outdoor climate, and keeps our planet healthy.
